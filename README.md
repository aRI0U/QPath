# QPath: Object-oriented filesystem paths for Qt applications

This repository implements the `QPath` class, which aims at being used in Qt apps for navigate into files. It is mainly based on Qt classes `QDir` and `QFileInfo` and inspired by Python module [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html).
